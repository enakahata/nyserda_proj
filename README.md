# nyserda_proj
Final project for ENV 603

These scripts include exploratory graphs of data made in R and my project proposal.
My current draft of graphs are in Tableau.
NYSERDA.twb contains graphs from the NYSERDA open dataset (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nyserda-supported-clean-energy-research-and-development-projects-beginning-1991).
Investment_needed.twb contains graphs of the additional capital investment needed by 2030 to remain on a pathway to net-zero by 2050.
